I’m sure you’ve already heard about it on the news: The Spokane real estate market is incredibly hot, but home inventory is low. **Let me demonstrate just how low it truly is.**

As you can see in the video at 0:40, there are only 46 listings for 3-bedroom homes under $200,000 in Northwest Spokane. If we take off the pending sales, there are only 7 homes that aren’t under contract already.

With the same criteria, South Hill Spokane has 15 listings altogether, and only 5 of those are actually available. Everything else is already under contract.

In Spokane Valley, there are 23 listings, but only 4 are not already under contract.

**If you’re thinking of selling, the high demand for homes can make a big difference in what you can sell for.** If you’re looking to buy, now’s the time to start thinking of a strategy. Either way, I’d be more than happy to sit down with you and figure out how you can achieve your real estate goals in the near future. Feel free to reach out to me; I look forward to hearing from you soon.
