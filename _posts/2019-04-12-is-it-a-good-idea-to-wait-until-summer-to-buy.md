Since inventory is low right now and there aren’t many homes to choose from, homebuyers have been asking: “Should I just wait to buy a home in the summer when more homes come on the market?”<br><br>Really, this is a conversation that I would like to have with individual people, because the answer to that depends on what you’re going for.

Typically, buyers fall into one of three categories:

“I’m looking for the best deal.”<br>“I’m looking for a specific type of home.”<br>“I want the best deal and the best home.”

Let’s address the first two types because everybody, on some level, falls into the third one.

If you’re looking for the best deal, the biggest questions are, “What’s happening with the real estate market? Are prices going up or down?”

So far, home prices have been trending upward, though they have slowed down. What, then, can we expect from the summer market?

Experts say that the economy is still strong and they’re anticipating home values to continue to increase steadily, getting us back to a healthy 3% to 4% appreciation.

Our Spokane market is very seasonal. If we look back at the average sales price over the last six or seven years in terms of winter versus summer, we typically saw a $25,000 to $35,000 gap (with winter being lower than summer).&nbsp;

**For buyers, that doesn’t mean that homes are going to cost more in the winter**; it just means that the market trends toward higher sales prices in the summer than the winter. In fact, there are some cases where we sell homes for more in the winter than in the summer. For some, that may just be a better time to put their home on the market.

Another factor to consider is the interest rate environment—**what might happen with those?**

Overall, we anticipate that rates will stay fairly steady, but if they do go up, you’ll have less buying power. That means you’ll be paying more money for the same amount of house.

So, if the perfect house that matches all your criteria came onto the market next week, would you be excited about it? If your answer to that is “yes,” then I encourage you not to give up on the search. I understand that the lack of inventory is frustrating, but **waiting until summer or later may put you in a position where you’ll have less affordability. &nbsp;**

In the end, I think you’ll be really happy that you stuck with it through this tough time. Hire a good Realtor to work hard for you and to represent your best interests and you should be good to go.
